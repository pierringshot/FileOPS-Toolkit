"""Discovery engine for FileOps Toolkit.

This module provides utilities to recursively search source directories for
files matching a set of extensions.  It yields absolute file paths for
downstream processing.  The current implementation uses Python's
``os.walk`` and is designed to be replaced or augmented with faster tools
such as ``fd``/``fdfind`` via subprocess if desired.

        sources: Iterable of directory paths to search.
        extensions: File suffixes (without leading dot) to include, caseâ€‘insensitive.

    Yields:

    This function traverses each source directory recursively using ``os.walk``.
    For performance on large directories, consider using the ``fdfind`` tool and
    parsing its output externally.
